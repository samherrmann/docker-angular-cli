# Angular CLI
A Docker image for [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Usage
1. Create a new Angular CLI project:
```sh
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/code samherrmann/angular-cli new my-app
```
2. Copy the [ng.sh](ng.sh) script into your project's root directory.

3. Use the script to execute Angular CLI commands:
```sh
$ ./ng.sh g module my-module
```
```sh
$ ./ng.sh g component my-component
```

### npm

1. Copy the [npm.sh](npm.sh) script into your project's root directory.
2. Use the script to execute `npm` commands:
```sh
./npm.sh install <my-new-lib>
```
```sh
./npm.sh start
```
```sh
./npm.sh run lint
```
