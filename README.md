# Angular CLI
A Docker image for running [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
in a container.
## Benefits
* Eliminate the need to manually confirm that you are running a version of
  Node.js/npm that is compatible with your version of Angular CLI.
* Ensure that all developers are running the same version of the build tools.
* Ensure that the build machine is running the same version of the build tools
  as the developers.
* Make switching between projects with different versions of the build tools
  transparent to the developers.
* Ensure that builds are reproducible.

## Usage
### One-Time Setup
1. Create a new Angular CLI project:
    ```sh
    docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/code --entrypoint ng samherrmann/angular-cli new my-app
    ```

2. Copy the [npm.sh](npm.sh) script into your project's root directory.
    * Change the `latest` version tag inside the `npm.sh` script to the actual
      version of the image (Ex: Replace `latest` with `1.6.2`).
    * Commit it to your version control system.

3. Add the following configuration to `angular-cli.json` to make the app
   accessible from the browser on the host machine:
    ```json
      "defaults": {
        "serve": {
          "host": "0.0.0.0"
        }
      }
    ```
4. Add the following configuration to your `karma.conf.js` to be able to
   leverage Google Chrome in the container for unit testing:

    ```js
    browsers: ['customChrome'],
    customLaunchers: {
      customChrome: {
        base: 'ChromeHeadless',
        flags: [
          '--no-sandbox'
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    The Chrome sandbox needs to be disabled when running inside of a Docker
    container because Chrome's sandbox requires more permissions than Docker
    allows by default. If there is a need to run the Chrome sandbox, then the
    container must be run with the `privileged` flag.

### Development Workflow
Execute Angular CLI commands:

```sh
./npm.sh run ng g m my-module
```
```sh
./npm.sh run ng g c my-module/my-component
```

Execute `npm` commands:
```sh
./npm.sh install <my-new-lib>
```
```sh
./npm.sh start
```
```sh
./npm.sh run lint
```
```sh
./npm.sh run test
```

## Development
### Build Image
Run the `./build.sh` script to build an image.

### Publish Image
Run the `./publish.sh` script to push an image to Docker Hub.
